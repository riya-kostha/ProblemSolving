Stream 
  group By ,reduce,
  q1- find first non repeating charcter in string 

default method in interface  also (diamond problem)

static method in interface

hashmap implemntation changes in java 8 
  
Things to remember in Collection
{
   Hashmap->hashTable->concurrentHashMap->syncronized hashMap
  ArrayList->vector->ReadonWriteArrayList

Note -> iterator.remove does not used concurrent collection
}
when we use runnable interface and types of thread
Runnable with run and start
overload run method and start
