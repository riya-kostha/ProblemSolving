metsapce for grabage collection in java 8 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/metaspace-in-java-8-with-examples/   

Impementation of hashmap Hint for collision use linkedlist

Concurrent (synchrinzed) collection with fail safe and fail fast iterator

Stream 
  group By ,reduce, must read reduce
  q1- find first non repeating charcter in string 
  q2-find longest string in list of string

default method in interface  also (diamond problem)  (If two  interface have same default method java confirm that you provide your own defination
by @override)

static method in interface

hashmap implemntation changes in java 8 (No implemnetation required for static method) 
  
Things to remember in Collection
{
   Hashmap->hashTable->concurrentHashMap(syncronized hashMap)
  ArrayList->vector->ReadonWriteArrayList
  Hashtable and vector are thread safe but not fail Failsafe (concurrent Modification)
while concurrentHashmap and readonWrite are
Note -> iterator.remove does not used concurrent collection

}
when we use runnable interface and types of thread
Runnable with run and start
overload run method and start 


finalize method for grabaze collector
